# README

This is a vanilla Hyrax 2.1.0 application that has minimal InstallScripts
integration.

It is intended to be used as a basis for forking new Hyrax 2.1 projects.

This repository is automatically mirrored from [its canonical source on code.vt.edu](https://code.vt.edu/pmather/hyrax-2.1.0),
so changes should not be made directly to this repository.
